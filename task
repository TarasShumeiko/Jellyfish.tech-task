Build the following in React - feel free to add any spin or flare that you think highlights the level of your skill:

Bitcoin Conversion Webpage

Build an Webpage that when you open it for the first time, it asks for your name and persists without using a database.

After that, it goes to a screen that says “Hello, <your name>!” and asks you which currency you’d like to use to convert from today’s Bitcoin value (you can choose three or four predefined currencies options to make things simpler and easier, or offer a search bar/scroll view with 10-20 types).

After confirming the desired currency, it takes you to another screen showing how much is 1 BTC converted to that chosen currency.

After you close and reopen the Webpage, it should not ask you for your name again, but instead take you directly to the second screen where it says “Hello, <your name>!” and asks about the desired currency.

If one minimizes the Webpage while on the third screen (conversion result screen) and opens the Webpage again, it should take the person to the second screen (currency chooser screen) instead of the third one.

We are looking for a production level code on this project so make sure to keep in mind things like proper code documentation, error handling, user interaction and so on.

We’re looking for an Webpage with a strong UI. This does not mean we expect your designs to be gorgeous, but we want you to use this opportunity to show us that you have a strong grasp on design patterns and infrastructure, and know how to build complex code that is easy to read and extend.

When you are done publish your code on Github and send us a public link.Feel free to add your own spin to show your full capability.

Send over your work as a github link.
